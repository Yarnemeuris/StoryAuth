# StoryAuth

StoryAuth is a new login system. That instead of using passwords, uses a story/comic made from emojis. Because it uses emojis and not characters, there are more than 27 million possible combinations by only placing 3 emojis per panel.

## creating an account
To create an account simply choose a username, and make a small story/comic. You can edit a pnel by clicking on it. Then you can add an emoji (if you're on windows you can open the emoji panel with `windows key + .` or `windows key + ;`) or change the background color. Don't make it to complecated. Because you need to remeber every emoji and it's location.
