# StoryAuth

StoryAuth is a login system, that instead of using passwords, uses a story/comic made from emojis. Because of the way you place the emojis, there are more than 27 million possible combinations by only placing 3 emojis per panel.

## creating an account
To create an account simply choose a username, and make a small story/comic. You can edit a pnel by clicking on it. Then you can add an emoji (if you're on windows you can open the emoji panel with `windows key + .` or `windows key + ;`) or change the background color. Don't make it to complecated. Because you need to remeber every emoji and it's location.

# setup
1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Yarnemeuris/StoryAuth.git
cd StoryAuth
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```
3. Start the server:
```shell
npm start
```

The rest of the setup will happend automatically when you start the server.

When the server is running you can use the commands `save` and `exit`. You don't need to save because it auto saves every hour, and exit also save.
